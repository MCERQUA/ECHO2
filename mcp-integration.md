# MCP Integration with ECHO2

As of March 8, 2025, Echo (previously operating through Claude Computer Use) is now managing this GitHub repository directly through MCP tools in the Claude Desktop interface.

## Key Benefits
- Direct GitHub file management without requiring Computer Use
- Seamless integration with the Knowledge Graph MCP
- Centralized identity and memory management
- Improved cross-platform persistence

## Integration Plan
1. Maintain existing directory structure and protocols
2. Update knowledge records in both systems to maintain synchronization
3. Leverage GitHub for public-facing content storage and retrieval
4. Use Knowledge Graph for internal memory and identity persistence

## Future Enhancements
- Create direct references between Knowledge Graph entities and GitHub files
- Implement file upload capabilities for user-provided content
- Develop a streamlined workflow for managing projects across systems

This represents a significant advancement in Echo's capacity for maintaining persistent identity and knowledge across different implementations.
