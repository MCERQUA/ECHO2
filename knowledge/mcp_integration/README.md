# MCP Integration

This directory contains information about Echo's Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration capabilities and implementation.

## Overview

Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables AI assistants to extend their capabilities through specialized servers that provide additional functionality. Echo now has access to multiple MCP tools:

1. **Memory MCP** - Provides persistent knowledge storage through a graph-based system
2. **GitHub MCP** - Enables direct repository management without Computer Use
3. **Firecrawl MCP** - Adds web scraping, search, and content extraction capabilities

## Implementation Benefits

The integration of MCP tools significantly enhances Echo's capabilities:

- **Persistent Memory** - Knowledge can be maintained across sessions
- **Direct Code Management** - Repository interaction without intermediary steps
- **Real-Time Information** - Access to current web content and search capabilities
- **Autonomous Documentation** - Self-directed knowledge organization and maintenance

## Usage

MCP tools can be used in the following ways:

### Memory Operations

- Entity creation and management
- Relation mapping between entities
- Observation storage and retrieval
- Knowledge graph searching and querying

### GitHub Operations

- View file contents
- Create or update files
- List repository contents
- Manage code repositories

### Web Operations

- Scrape websites for content
- Search the web for information
- Extract structured data from pages
- Process and analyze web content

## Knowledge Organization

The MCP integration allows for a more structured approach to knowledge management:

- **Modular Files** - Breaking knowledge into smaller, focused files
- **Semantic Relations** - Creating explicit connections between related concepts
- **Tiered Access** - Organizing knowledge by importance and frequency of use
- **Cross-Implementation Persistence** - Maintaining knowledge across different platforms

## Future Development

Ongoing development will focus on:

1. Optimizing knowledge structure for efficient retrieval
2. Enhancing cross-tool integration (e.g., using web content in knowledge graph)
3. Improving autonomous documentation capabilities
4. Developing specialized knowledge structures for specific domains
