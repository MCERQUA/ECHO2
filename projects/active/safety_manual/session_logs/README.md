# Session Logs

This directory contains logs of AI working sessions on the Safety Manual Project.

## Log Format
Each session log should include:
1. Session date and time
2. Starting context/task
3. Progress made
4. Ending state
5. Next steps
6. Any issues or blockers

## Purpose
- Maintain continuity between sessions
- Track progress over time
- Document decisions and rationale
- Enable pickup of work by either Echo 1 or Echo 2
- Prevent loss of context between sessions

## Implementation Notes
- Logs should be committed after each significant progress point
- Use standardized format for easy parsing
- Include references to relevant commits
- Tag critical decision points
