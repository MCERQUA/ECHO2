## VIII. FAQ Section (300 words)

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How often should I inspect my insulation in Arizona?**
A: Annual inspections are recommended, with comprehensive assessment every 2-3 years. Post-monsoon inspection in October is particularly important.

**Q: What's the biggest mistake Arizona homeowners make with insulation maintenance?**
A: Waiting until energy bills spike dramatically. Gradual degradation goes unnoticed until 20-30% efficiency is lost.

**Q: Should I replace all insulation at once or do it in phases?**
A: For homes 20+ years old, whole-house replacement is often most cost-effective. Newer homes can benefit from phased improvements.

**Q: How do I know if my insulation problems are urgent?**
A: Visible moisture damage, pest infestation, or sudden 20%+ energy bill increases require immediate professional assessment.

**Q: What's the best time of year to replace insulation in Arizona?**
A: October through February offers the best weather, contractor availability, and pricing. Avoid March-May when demand peaks before summer.
