        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Both spray foam and fiberglass can work effectively in Arizona, but spray foam generally performs better in extreme desert conditions due to superior air sealing and maintained R-value at high temperatures. The best choice depends on your budget, home construction, and performance priorities."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Spray foam typically costs $1.50-2.50 per square foot compared to fiberglass at $0.60-1.20 per square foot. However, spray foam often provides better long-term ROI through energy savings and longevity in Arizona's extreme climate."

        "@type": "Answer", 
        "text": "Spray foam insulation maintains its R-value and performance even at the 150-160°F temperatures common in Arizona attics. Fiberglass can lose 10-20% of its R-value at these extreme temperatures, making spray foam more effective for desert conditions."
      }

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Is spray foam worth the extra cost in Arizona?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "For many Arizona homeowners, yes. The superior air sealing, maintained performance in extreme heat, and 25+ year lifespan often justify the higher upfront cost through energy savings and improved comfort, especially for long-term homeownership."
      }

    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Can I install fiberglass insulation myself in Arizona?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, fiberglass can be DIY installed, but timing is critical in Arizona. Avoid summer months when attic temperatures exceed safe working conditions. Fall, winter, and early spring provide safer installation conditions for homeowners."
