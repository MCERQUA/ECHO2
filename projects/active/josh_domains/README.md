## Development Plan

The recommended approach for developing these domains is:

2. **Updating Domain Status**
   - When a domain status changes (e.g., becomes active), update all files
   - Make sure to update the forwarding URL if applicable
   - Verify that master list status is updated

3. **Exporting Updated Data**
   - After making changes, export updated data files
   - Make sure JSON and CSV files remain synchronized
   - Keep the master list current with latest domain statuses
