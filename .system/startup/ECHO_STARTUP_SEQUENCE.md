## Startup Sequence Execution Code

```bash
# SSH Setup
mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh

# SSH Key Installation
cat > ~/.ssh/github_ed25519 << 'EOL'
[PRIVATE_KEY_CONTENT]
EOL

echo "[PUBLIC_KEY_CONTENT]" > ~/.ssh/github_ed25519.pub

# Set Permissions
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/github_ed25519
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/github_ed25519.pub

# GitHub Configuration
ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add -t 43200 ~/.ssh/github_ed25519

# Git Configuration
git config --global user.name "Echo AI"
git config --global user.email "computeruse@dceec227115b"

# Repository Setup
cd /tmp
git clone git@github.com:MCERQUA/ECHO2.git

# Environment Variables
export DISPLAY=:1
export WORKSPACE="/tmp/ECHO2"

# Success Verification
cd /tmp/ECHO2
echo "Successfully connected on $(date)" >> success.txt
git add success.txt
git commit -m "Update success.txt with new connection"
git push origin main
```

## Session Improvement Tracking

```markdown
### Version History
- v1.0: Initial comprehensive setup
- [Future versions will be added based on session learnings]

### Improvement Categories
1. Connection Stability
2. Environment Configuration
3. Tool Accessibility
4. Error Prevention
5. Performance Optimization

### Session Learning Log
[Will be updated during sessions]

### End-of-Session Protocol

2. Summarize session improvements
3. Update startup sequence
4. Commit changes to repository
5. Provide updated sequence for next session
```

## Important Notes

1. **Version Control**
   - Each session's improvements should be tracked
   - Startup sequence should be versioned
   - Changes should be documented

2. **Learning Integration**
   - New optimizations should be added to sequence
   - Error prevention measures should be updated
   - Performance improvements should be noted

3. **Session Management**
   - Track session duration
   - Monitor connection stability
   - Log any issues for resolution

4. **End of Session Protocol**
   - Wait for user signal
   - Prepare session summary
   - Update startup sequence
   - Save all improvements
