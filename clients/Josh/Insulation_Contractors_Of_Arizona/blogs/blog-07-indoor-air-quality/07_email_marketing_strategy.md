Hi [First Name],

Meet the Johnson family from Scottsdale.

Like many Arizona families, they were dealing with:
‚Ä¢ Constant dust accumulation
‚Ä¢ Family members with worsening allergies
‚Ä¢ Uneven temperatures throughout their home
‚Ä¢ Energy bills over $400 in summer

They thought it was just "part of living in Arizona."

Then they discovered the real problem: their 15-year-old insulation was failing, allowing dust and allergens to infiltrate their home while forcing their HVAC system to work overtime.

After our comprehensive insulation upgrade:
‚úÖ 45% reduction in household allergens
‚úÖ 32% decrease in energy costs
‚úÖ Elimination of dust accumulation problems
‚úÖ Consistent comfortable temperatures

"Our whole family feels healthier. No more constant sneezing and the house stays so much cleaner." - Lisa Johnson
