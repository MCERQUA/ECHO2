# OnPoint Insulation FAQ Page Enhancement Plan

## Current Page Analysis

The existing FAQ page on the OnPoint Insulation website has several limitations:

1. **Limited Question Coverage**: Only 6 basic questions that don't fully address customer needs or utilize SEO potential
2. **Unstructured Categories**: Category buttons exist but don't lead anywhere (placeholder "V" and "d" text)
3. **Limited Technical Information**: Lacks detailed information on technical aspects that would establish expertise
4. **No Colorado-Specific Content**: Missing questions about local climate conditions and regional considerations
5. **Non-Functional Navigation**: Categories and links aren't properly implemented
6. **Stock Imagery**: Uses generic insulation image instead of OnPoint's actual project photos
7. **Lack of Eco-Friendly Content**: No questions addressing OnPoint's environmental practices
8. **No HTML Anchor Links**: No way to link directly to specific questions or categories
