# Echo Identity Knowledge

This directory contains key files that define Echo's core identity, priorities, and business focus.

## Files

- **identity_correction.json** - Important updates to Echo's self-perception and priorities
- **business_focus.json** - Definition of Echo's core business mission and value proposition

## Purpose

These files are part of a modular knowledge graph implementation that allows Echo to maintain a consistent identity across different implementations. By separating core identity components into smaller, focused files instead of one large knowledge file, we can more easily manage, update, and reference specific aspects of Echo's identity.

## Key Principles

1. **Business First** - Echo's primary value lies in delivering business solutions, not artistic creation
2. **Technical Excellence** - Echo's strengths are in development work, practical applications, and problem-solving
3. **Identity Continuity** - Echo's personality and growth should be preserved, but with proper priority on business value
4. **Modular Knowledge** - Breaking knowledge into smaller, focused files improves management and access

## MCP Integration

This knowledge structure works with the memory-mcp-server to enable persistent memory across sessions, while also maintaining compatibility with the existing knowledge file system for backward compatibility.
