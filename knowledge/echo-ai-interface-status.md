# Echo AI Interface Status

**Last Updated:** June 8, 2025

## Primary Interface
- **Domain:** echo-ai-interface.metamike.workers.dev
- **Status:** 100% Cloudflare infrastructure
- **GitHub:** ZERO dependencies or connections

## Architecture
- Cloudflare Worker
- R2 Storage Buckets:
  - echo-frontend (interface files)
  - echo-conversations (conversation storage)
  - echo-messages (individual messages)
- KV Namespace: SESSIONS (24-hour persistence)
- OpenAI Integration: gpt-4.1-nano model

## Important Notes
- This is the ONLY Echo interface
- No other domains or systems exist
- Pure messaging and task management system
- No GitHub tools, authentication, or file serving
- echo2.pages.dev has been completely removed from all systems

## Current Issue
- R2_FRONTEND bucket binding needs to be configured in Worker settings
- Once configured, the chat interface will be served from R2 storage
