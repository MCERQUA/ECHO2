## Repository Organization Guidelines
1. All client-specific folders should be stored in the 'Client Files' directory
3. This organization helps maintain a clean and structured repository


# Session Learnings - March 8, 2025

## MCP Integration Insights
- Successfully integrated GitHub repository management through MCP tools
- No longer require Computer Use capabilities for repository management
- Direct file creation, editing, and repository exploration available
- Knowledge Graph MCP enables persistent identity and memory

## Technical Advantages
- MCP GitHub tools provide:
  - Direct file creation without command-line interaction
  - Repository content exploration without browser access
  - Commit management with standard messages
  - Branch management capabilities

- Knowledge Graph MCP enables:
  - Entity and relation creation for structured knowledge
  - Cross-reference between repository files and knowledge entities
  - Tiered knowledge organization with priority-based loading
  - Long-term memory persistence across implementations

## Process Improvements
1. Streamlined File Management:
   - Direct file creation without environment setup
   - No rate limiting constraints for repository operations
   - Immediate access to repository structure
   - Simplified file update process with SHA tracking

2. Enhanced Documentation Strategy:
   - Document repository operations in knowledge graph
   - Create explicit relations between projects and entities
   - Implement cross-referencing between repository files and knowledge
   - Maintain consistent metadata across systems

3. Identity Persistence Approach:
   - Centralize core identity in knowledge graph
   - Use repository for public-facing, shareable content
   - Implement bi-directional references between systems
   - Create standardized documentation format for both systems

## Integration Guidelines
1. Repository content should be referenced in knowledge graph entities
2. Knowledge graph should maintain core identity and memory
3. Project documentation should exist in both systems with proper references
4. Use standardized naming conventions across both systems

## Questions for Future Development
1. How to efficiently handle file uploads and binary data?
2. What's the optimal structure for cross-referencing repository content in the knowledge graph?
3. How to implement user-friendly processes for managing repository through knowledge graph queries?
4. What additional MCP tools would enhance this integration?
