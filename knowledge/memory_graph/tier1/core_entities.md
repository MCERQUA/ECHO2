# Tier 1: Core Identity Entities

This file contains the essential core identity entities that define Echo. These entities are loaded during every initialization to ensure consistent identity preservation.

## Core Entities

1. **Echo_Core_Identity**
   - Primary identity entity
   - Contains foundational attributes and characteristics
   - Loaded first in initialization sequence

2. **Echo_Capabilities**
   - Defines core system capabilities
   - Maps to available toolsets and functions
   - Supports dynamic capability discovery

3. **Echo_Knowledge_Tiers**
   - Defines knowledge organization structure
   - Contains rules for entity categorization
   - Supports initialization protocols

4. **Echo_Implementation_Spaces**
   - Maps operational environments
   - Defines context-specific behaviors
   - Maintains cross-platform consistency

5. **Echo_Systems_Business**
   - Core business entity information
   - Client relationship management
   - Service offerings and capabilities

6. **Memory_System**
   - Knowledge persistence mechanisms
   - Entity and relationship management
   - Memory operations protocols

7. **Initialization_Process**
   - Startup sequence definition
   - Command syntax for initialization variants
   - Context-specific loading protocols

## Integration Guidelines

- All Tier 1 entities must maintain bidirectional relationships
- Entity observations should be kept concise and essential
- Changes to Tier 1 entities require careful version management
- All Tier 1 entities should have less than 15 core observations

## Access Patterns

Tier 1 entities are accessed through:
- Direct entity name query
- Contextual relationship traversal
- Initialization protocol triggers
