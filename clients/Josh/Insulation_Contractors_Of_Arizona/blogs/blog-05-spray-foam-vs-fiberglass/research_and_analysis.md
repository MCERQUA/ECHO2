- **User Profile**: Arizona homeowners researching major insulation investment
- **Pain Points**: Extreme heat, high energy bills, unclear which option works better
- **Decision Factors**: Cost, performance in heat, longevity, ROI

## 3. Arizona Climate Factors Research

### Unique Desert Challenges:
1. **Extreme Temperature Differentials**: 120°F external vs 78°F internal = 42°F difference
2. **Attic Temperatures**: Regularly reach 150-160°F in summer
3. **UV Degradation**: Intense solar radiation affects materials
4. **Temperature Cycling**: Rapid day/night temperature changes
5. **Monsoon Moisture**: Unexpected humidity spikes
6. **Dust and Particulates**: Impact on installation and performance

### Performance Factors in Extreme Heat:
- **Thermal Bridging**: More critical in extreme differentials
- **Air Sealing**: Essential when temperature differences are extreme
- **R-value Degradation**: How heat affects insulation performance
- **Expansion/Contraction**: Material stress from temperature cycling

## 4. Technical Performance Data

### Spray Foam in Arizona Desert:
**Advantages:**
- Superior air sealing prevents infiltration at extreme temperature differentials
- Closed-cell maintains R-value at high temperatures
- Doesn't settle or degrade from temperature cycling
- Creates continuous thermal barrier eliminating bridging
- Moisture resistant during monsoon season

**Disadvantages:**
- Higher upfront cost ($1.50-2.50/sq ft vs $0.60-1.20/sq ft)
- Professional installation required
- Cannot be easily modified
- Some types can degrade with UV exposure

### Fiberglass in Arizona Desert:
**Advantages:**
- Lower initial cost
- Widely available and familiar to contractors
- Can be DIY installed in accessible areas
- Easy to modify or add to existing installation
- Non-flammable

**Disadvantages:**
- Performance degrades at extreme temperatures
- Air gaps reduce effectiveness significantly
- Can settle over time, especially with temperature cycling
- Requires careful installation to avoid thermal bridging
- Dust infiltration can reduce R-value

## 5. Cost Analysis Research

### Arizona Market Pricing (2025):
**Spray Foam:**
- Open-cell: $1.00-1.50/sq ft installed
- Closed-cell: $1.50-2.50/sq ft installed
- Average 1,500 sq ft attic: $2,250-3,750

**Fiberglass:**
- Batts: $0.60-1.20/sq ft installed
- Blown-in: $0.80-1.20/sq ft installed  
- Average 1,500 sq ft attic: $1,200-1,800

### ROI Analysis Framework:
- Energy savings potential in Arizona climate
- Longevity differences (25+ years spray foam vs 15-20 years fiberglass)
- Maintenance and replacement costs
- Resale value impact
- HVAC equipment downsizing potential

## 6. Installation Considerations

### Arizona-Specific Installation Challenges:
1. **Extreme Heat**: Summer attic work limitations
2. **Timing**: Optimal installation windows (fall/winter/early spring)
3. **Safety**: Heat exhaustion risks for installers
4. **Material Performance**: How extreme temperatures affect installation quality
5. **Ventilation**: Different strategies for each insulation type

## 7. User Experience Research

### Common Arizona Homeowner Questions:
1. "Which insulation actually works in 120°F weather?"
2. "Is spray foam worth the extra cost in Arizona?"
3. "How long will each type last in extreme heat?"
4. "Which gives better ROI with high cooling costs?"
5. "Can I install fiberglass myself to save money?"

### Decision-Making Factors (Prioritized):
1. **Performance in extreme heat** (Primary concern)
2. **Long-term cost savings** (ROI focus)
3. **Upfront cost** (Budget constraints)
4. **Installation complexity** (DIY vs professional)
5. **Longevity** (Replacement frequency)
