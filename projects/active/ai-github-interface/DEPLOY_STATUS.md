## CRITICAL FIX APPLIED: June 6, 2025 9:02 PM

### Issue
The Echo Communication Terminal at echo2.pages.dev was stuck on initialization screen forever.

### Root Cause
The Cloudflare Pages deployment wasn't correctly using the _worker.js file for API endpoints.

### Solution
1. Created `functions/_worker.js` following Cloudflare Pages Functions structure
2. This provides all necessary API endpoints:
   - `/api/health` - Health check
   - `/api/chat` - Main chat endpoint with OpenAI integration
   - `/api/session/*` - Session management
   - `/api/projects` - Project listing

### Required Environment Variables
Add these in Cloudflare Pages dashboard:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key (required)
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Your GitHub personal access token (required)
- `SESSIONS` or `KV` - KV namespace binding for session storage (optional but recommended)

### Deployment Configuration
In Cloudflare Pages settings:
- Build output directory: `projects/active/ai-github-interface/frontend`
- Functions directory: Automatically detected as `functions`

### Next Steps
1. Go to Cloudflare Pages dashboard
2. Add the required environment variables
3. Trigger a new deployment
4. Verify at https://echo2.pages.dev/api/health
