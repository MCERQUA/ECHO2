# AI GitHub Interface - FIXED! ✅

## Website: https://echo2.pages.dev

## Status: WORKING ✅

### Latest Fix (June 6, 2025)

**Problem**: Cloudflare deployment was failing with "multipart uploads must contain a readable body_part" error.

**Root Cause**: Cloudflare Pages was detecting both `_worker.js` in root AND a `functions` directory. You can only use one approach:
- **Advanced mode**: `_worker.js` in root
- **Functions mode**: files in `/functions` directory

**Solution**: We're now using Advanced mode with `_worker.js` in the root directory.

### Critical File Structure

```
frontend/
├── _worker.js          # ✅ MAIN WORKER FILE (Advanced mode)
├── functions/          # Directory still exists but worker is disabled
│   └── _worker.js     # Empty placeholder to prevent conflicts
├── index.html
├── chat.js
├── terminal.js
└── [other files]
```

### Environment Variables (REQUIRED)

Set these in Cloudflare Pages Dashboard > Settings > Environment Variables:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key (required)
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - GitHub Personal Access Token (required)
- `SESSIONS` or `KV` - KV namespace binding (optional for session storage)

### How We Fixed It

1. **Session Handling Bug**: Fixed the "tool messages without tool_calls" error by filtering tool messages from conversation history
2. **File Location**: Moved the working code to `frontend/_worker.js` (root)
3. **Disabled Functions Mode**: Emptied `functions/_worker.js` to prevent conflicts

### Features Working Now
✅ GitHub repository search
✅ File reading/writing  
✅ Issue creation
✅ Session persistence (no more errors!)
✅ Cost tracking ($0.50-$1.00/month)
✅ Professional terminal interface

### Deployment
- Automatic via GitHub push to main branch
- Build output directory: `projects/active/ai-github-interface/frontend`
- No build command needed

### Troubleshooting

1. **Check API Health**: https://echo2.pages.dev/api/health
2. **If deployment fails**: Check that only ONE `_worker.js` exists in root
3. **If API errors**: Verify environment variables in Cloudflare

The website is now fully functional with the ultra cost-effective gpt-4.1-nano model!
