# Task Completion Tracking

This directory contains small marker files to track completed tasks.

## How it Works:
- When a task is completed, a small file named `TASKID_COMPLETE.json` is created
- The file contains basic completion info: timestamp, who completed it, notes
- Echo can quickly scan this directory to see what's done without reading large files

## File Naming Convention:
- `T001_COMPLETE.json` - Task 1 completed
- `T002_COMPLETE.json` - Task 2 completed  
- etc.

## Status Check:
To check progress, Echo reads the main task list, then scans this directory for completion files.
