# Cloudflare Pages Deployment Debug Guide

## Current Status
- Deployment failing with "repository not found" error
- Repository URL shows trailing slash: `https://github.com/MCERQUA/echo2/`

## Environment Variables Present
- GITHUB_TOKEN ✓
- GROQ_API_KEY ✓
- HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN ✓
- MCP_SERVER_URL ✓
- OPENAI_API_KEY ✓

## Possible Issues

### 1. Repository Access
The error suggests Cloudflare Pages cannot access the repository. This could be due to:
- GitHub integration needs re-authorization
- Repository permissions changed
- Cloudflare Pages bug with trailing slash

### 2. Code Issues
Files that might be causing problems:
- `wrangler.toml` - Should not exist for Pages deployments
- Conflicting worker files

### 3. Build Configuration
Current settings should be:
- Build command: (empty)
- Build output directory: `projects/active/ai-github-interface/frontend`
- Root directory: (empty)

## Immediate Actions

1. **Check Cloudflare Pages Dashboard**
   - Go to the project settings
   - Check "Source code" section
   - Verify repository shows as `MCERQUA/echo2` (no slash)

2. **Try Manual Trigger**
   - Click "Retry deployment" on the failed build
   - Or push any small change to trigger new build

3. **If Still Failing**
   - Disconnect and reconnect GitHub
   - Or create new Pages project

## Note
The code changes (adding Hugging Face tools) should NOT cause repository access issues. This appears to be a Cloudflare Pages or GitHub integration problem.
