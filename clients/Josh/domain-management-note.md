## Technical Architecture
- **Front-end**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Data Storage**: CSV/JSON files for domain data (with GitHub as the persistent storage)

## Domain Categories

## Note
This separation allows for easier management of the large domain portfolio while keeping specific website project files organized in the ECHO2 repository.
