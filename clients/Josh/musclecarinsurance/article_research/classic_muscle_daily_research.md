- **Maintenance Frequency**: Oil changes every 3,000 miles, frequent tune-ups
- **Parts Availability**: Varies by model popularity, can include long wait times
- **Specialized Knowledge Required**: Carburetor adjustment, ignition timing
- **Safety Features**: Limited to basic lap belts in many cars
- **Emissions**: Not compatible with modern standards without modifications
- **Theft Concerns**: Easily stolen, limited security features

## Owner Experiences and Testimonials

*Note: We will need to gather actual testimonials from real owners through forums, social media, or direct interviews*

### Common Owner Reports
- Daily driving duration: Many owners report 5+ years of daily use
- Average annual maintenance costs: $1,500-$3,000 reported
- Most valuable upgrades: EFI, disc brakes, and A/C consistently mentioned
- Biggest challenges: Parts availability, specialized knowledge needs
- Most frequent repairs: Carburetor adjustment, cooling system issues

### Geographical Considerations
- Cold climate challenges: Cold starting, heater inadequacy, salt/rust concerns
