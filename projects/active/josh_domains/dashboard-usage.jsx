/**
 * Implementation Notes:
 * 
 * 1. The dashboard is designed to be a reusable component that can be updated as new domains are added
 * 2. When new domains are added to domains-spreadsheet.json, the dashboard will automatically update
 * 3. The domains-spreadsheet.json file can be edited directly or through a server-side admin interface
 * 4. The batch configuration could also be moved to a separate JSON file for easier maintenance
 * 
 * Next Steps:
 * 
 * 1. Complete the template system with working blog functionality
 * 2. Add site generation scripts to automate deployment
 * 3. Create a backend admin interface for domain management
 * 4. Implement batch deployment system
