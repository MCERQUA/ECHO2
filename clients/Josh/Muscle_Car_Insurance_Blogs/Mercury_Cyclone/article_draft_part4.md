## Owner Interview: Spotlight on a Notable Cyclone Collection

**Bob Johnson's Mercury Cyclone Passion**

Bob Johnson of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, owns one of the most comprehensive Mercury Cyclone collections in the United States. His seven-car collection spans the model's entire production run and includes several rare specimens.

**Q: What attracted you to Mercury Cyclones specifically?**

"I grew up watching NASCAR in the late '60s when the Mercury aerocars were dominating. Cale Yarborough in that white and red Cyclone was my hero. When most kids wanted a Mustang or Camaro, I wanted a Cyclone. There's something special about these cars—they're different, they're rare, and they have legitimate racing history."

**Q: Which model in your collection is the most significant?**

"That would be my 1969 Cyclone Spoiler II. It's one of the 503 built for NASCAR homologation, blue with white stripes, and has the 428 Cobra Jet. Finding a documented, numbers-matching example took me nearly 15 years. These cars almost never change hands anymore—most are in museums or long-term collections."

**Q: What are the challenges of owning these cars compared to more common muscle cars?**

"Parts availability is the biggest hurdle. For my '64 Comet Cyclone, I can sometimes use Falcon parts. For the '68 and '69 cars, some Torino parts interchange. But anything Cyclone-specific—trim pieces, emblems, unique interior parts—can be nearly impossible to find. I've had to have things fabricated or restored that simply can't be replaced. The upside is that other Cyclone owners form a tight community, and we help each other out."

**Q: How do people react to your Cyclones at car shows?**

"That's the rewarding part. At any show, there might be a dozen Mustangs or Camaros, but my Cyclones are often the only ones there. People are genuinely curious—many have never seen one in person. I love explaining the NASCAR connection and showing the aerodynamic features of the Spoiler II. The tunneled rear window and those flying buttresses on the '68-'69 models always get attention."

**Q: What advice would you give to someone interested in acquiring a Mercury Cyclone?**

"Do your homework first. These cars have specific mechanical and body issues that differ from other Fords. Join the Mercury Cyclone Registry and talk to current owners. Be patient and don't rush into a purchase—there aren't many out there, and it might take time to find the right one. Budget more for restoration than you think you'll need; the scarcity of parts makes these more expensive to restore properly than more common muscle cars. But it's all worth it when you're driving something truly special that turns heads wherever you go."

**Q: Which model would you recommend for a first-time Cyclone buyer?**

"A 1970 Cyclone GT makes a great entry point—they're somewhat more available than the earlier cars, parts sharing with Torinos helps with restoration, and they still have impressive performance with the 429 engine. They're also typically less expensive than the more sought-after '69 models. If you're patient, you might find one that doesn't need a full restoration, which is ideal for getting into the Cyclone community."

## Insurance Considerations for Mercury Cyclone Owners

Owning a classic Mercury Cyclone requires specialized insurance coverage designed for collector vehicles. Standard auto insurance typically doesn't adequately protect these valuable assets, as it fails to account for their appreciating value and unique usage patterns.

### Specialized Collector Car Insurance

Collector car insurance offers significant advantages for Cyclone owners:

1. **Agreed Value Coverage:** Unlike standard insurance, which pays depreciated "actual cash value" in the event of a total loss, collector policies pay a predetermined "agreed value" established when the policy is written. This ensures that a properly insured rare model like a Cyclone Spoiler II will be covered for its full collector market value rather than a generic book value.

2. **Lower Premiums:** Despite higher vehicle values, collector policies typically cost 40-60% less than standard insurance because these vehicles are driven less frequently and generally maintained with greater care.

3. **Flexible Usage:** Most policies allow for occasional pleasure driving and car show participation without restrictions, though annual mileage limits typically apply (usually 2,500-5,000 miles).

4. **Specialized Claims Handling:** Adjusters familiar with classic cars understand the unique restoration challenges and value considerations of rare models like the Cyclone.

### Valuation Considerations

Accurate valuation is critical for proper Mercury Cyclone insurance:

- **Documentation:** Maintain detailed records of the vehicle's provenance, restoration work, matching numbers status, and rare options to substantiate its insured value.

- **Regular Appraisals:** Given the Cyclone's rising values, particularly for rare variants, owners should obtain professional appraisals every 2-3 years to ensure coverage remains adequate.

- **Model-Specific Factors:** Insurance values vary dramatically based on specifics:
  - A 1969 Cyclone Spoiler II might require insurance coverage 4-5 times higher than a standard 1970 Cyclone
  - Documented 427 or 428 Cobra Jet engines significantly impact valuation
  - NASCAR heritage models command substantial premiums

### Storage and Security Requirements

Most collector policies require specific storage and security provisions:

- **Enclosed, Locked Storage:** A secure garage or storage facility is typically required
- **Security Systems:** Alarm systems or immobilizers may be required for high-value examples
- **Trailering Coverage:** If transporting to shows, ensure the policy covers the vehicle while being trailered

### Recommended Insurance Providers

Several companies specialize in collector car insurance with programs well-suited to Mercury Cyclone owners:

- **Hagerty Insurance:** Offers the most comprehensive collector car program with excellent valuation resources
- **American Collectors Insurance:** Known for competitive rates and flexible usage allowances
- **J.C. Taylor:** Specializes in rare muscle cars with emphasis on modified vehicles
- **Grundy Insurance:** Features a "no fixed mileage" restriction, ideal for owners who drive their Cyclones regularly

### Cost Expectations

Insurance costs vary significantly based on the specific Cyclone model, agreed value, and owner's location and driving record, but general guidelines include:

- **Standard 1966-1971 Cyclone:** $350-$500 annually for $50,000 coverage
- **Cyclone GT with 390/428:** $400-$650 annually for $75,000 coverage
- **Rare 1969 Spoiler/Spoiler II:** $800-$1,200 annually for $125,000+ coverage

By securing appropriate collector car insurance, Mercury Cyclone owners can protect their investment while enjoying these rare pieces of automotive history with confidence.
