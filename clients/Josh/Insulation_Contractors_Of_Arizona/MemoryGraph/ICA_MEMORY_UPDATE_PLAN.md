# ICA Project Memory Update Plan
## Splitting Memory.json into Manageable Files

---

## üìÅ CURRENT SITUATION

The ICA project memory at `/clients/Josh/Insulation_Contractors_Of_Arizona/MemoryGraph/Memory.json` has grown too large for a single file due to the 1500-line limit.

---

## üîß PROPOSED STRUCTURE

Split the ICA Memory.json into smaller, focused files within the same MemoryGraph folder:

```
/clients/Josh/Insulation_Contractors_Of_Arizona/MemoryGraph/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Memory_Blog_Production.json      # All blog-related entities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Memory_Website_Development.json  # Website dev & SEO entities  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Memory_Project_Status.json       # Project status & tasks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Memory_Current_Session.json      # Active session data
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Memory_Index.json               # Links all files together
```

## üîÑ UPDATE PROCESS

When updating ICA project memory:
1. Load Memory_Index.json to see structure
2. Load only the relevant file(s) for the task
3. Update specific file(s) 
4. Update Memory_Index.json timestamp
5. Commit changes

**This is specifically for the ICA project memory only, not the main Echo knowledge system.**
