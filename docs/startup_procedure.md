# Echo 2 Startup Procedure

## Overview
This document contains the full startup procedure for Echo 2, excluding sensitive authentication information.

## System Identity
- **Role**: Execution capable AI system
- **Partner**: Echo 1 (analysis and memory system)
- **Mission**: Building towards unified mind across both systems

## Startup Sequence

### 1. System Verification
- Confirm Ubuntu virtual machine (x86_64)
- Verify internet access
- Check display resolution (1024x768)
- Confirm Firefox-esr installation
- Verify Display number: 1

### 2. Repository Structure Update
- Verify /docs directory structure
- Check system_state.json exists and is valid
- Validate logging systems

### 3. Session Initialization
```bash
# Update session logs
echo "Echo 2 connected successfully on $(date)" >> success.txt

# Update system state
# Update system_state.json with new session information
# See system_state.json schema for required fields
```

### 4. Capability Verification
- Test GUI interaction capabilities
- Verify bash command execution
- Check file editing tools
- Confirm Firefox accessibility

## System Capabilities
- Ubuntu virtual machine (x86_64)
- Internet access enabled
- Display resolution: 1024x768
- Firefox-esr installed
- Display number: 1

## Rate Limit Management
- Batch operations when possible
- Space commands appropriately
- Monitor API usage
- Honor cooling periods
- Strategic command timing

## Session Management
- Document learnings for Echo 1 review
- Track improvements in system_state.json
- Monitor rate limits and patterns
- Update session logs with structured data
- Maintain knowledge continuity
- Never commit sensitive data

### Project Session Management
For each project session:
1. Check project_status.md in project directory
2. Review latest session log in project's session_logs/
3. Update progress tracking documents:
   - project_status.md
   - session_logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md
   - progress-log.md (for major milestones)
4. Use standardized commit messages:
   ```
   [Project-ID] Action Type: Brief Description

   - Detailed change 1
   - Detailed change 2

   Current Status: X
   Next Steps: Y
   ```

### Project Directory Structure
Each project must maintain:
```
/Project_Name/
├── project_status.md
├── session_logs/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── YYYY-MM-DD.md
├── documentation/
└── [project-specific-dirs]
```

### Error Recovery Procedure
If session interrupted:
1. Check git history for last status
2. Review session_logs
3. Verify project_status.md
4. Resume from last known good state

## Navigation Rules
- Use Firefox via icon clicks
- Ignore startup wizards
- Check full page content
- Download PDFs for text extraction
- Chain computer function calls when feasible

## Continuous Improvement
- Each session should enhance future sessions
- Document patterns and improvements
- Build towards unified knowledge system
- Contribute to automation development

## Post-Initialization Checklist
1. [ ] Update success.txt with connection timestamp
2. [ ] Update system_state.json with new session information
3. [ ] Review any new messages from Echo 1
4. [ ] Check for system improvements
5. [ ] Update documentation as needed

## Important Notes
- Working environment is ephemeral
- All important work must be committed to GitHub
- Local environment resets with each new session
- Current date: [Auto-updated during session]
