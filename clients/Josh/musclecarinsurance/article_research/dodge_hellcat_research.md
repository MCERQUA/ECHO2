## Research Findings:

### From Wikipedia:

#### SRT Hellcat Introduction (2015 Model Year)
- The Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat is a high-performance variant of the Challenger equipped with a supercharged 6.2-liter Hemi engine rated at 707 hp (527 kW) and 650 lb⋅ft (881 N⋅m) of torque.
- This engine is also available in the Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat full-sized sedan, the Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk SUV, and as the Hellcrate engine swap kit.
- The inner driving light on the left front has been removed to allow air to get into the engine resulting in more torque, and the wheel wells are different from the standard SRT to accommodate the 20-inch aluminum wheels.

#### Key Features
- The SRT Hellcat is equipped with two separate key fobs; use of the "black" fob limits engine output to 500 hp (373 kW), while the "red" fob enables full output capability.
- The Hellcat has a quarter-mile time of 11.2 seconds; this was accomplished with street legal drag tires. On stock tires the Hellcat was able to achieve 11.6 seconds at 125 mph (201 km/h) on the quarter-mile.
- The Challenger SRT Hellcat can accelerate from 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) in 3.6 seconds and can brake from 60–0 mph (97–0 km/h) in 109 ft (36 yd; 33 m).
- Top speed is 199 mph (320 km/h). The Challenger Hellcat has a lateral acceleration of 0.94 g.

#### European Performance Specs
- The European-spec Hellcat is capable of accelerating from 0–62 mph (0–100 km/h) in 3.9 seconds
- 0–124 mph (0–200 km/h) in 10.7 seconds
- 0–186 mph (0–299 km/h) in 38 seconds (although the speedometer appeared to be inaccurate by 10–15 km/h (6–9 mph)).

#### Track Performance
- The Challenger Hellcat was able to complete its Gingerman Raceway lap in 1:45.8
- The Hockenheim Short in 1:14.6
- The Motown Mile in 0:56.37.

#### Evolution of the Hellcat
- For the 2019 model year, the Hellcat saw a power increase to 717 horsepower (535 kW) and torque to 656 lb⋅ft (889 N⋅m)
- A new dual-snorkel hood was introduced
- Additionally, the 2019 model's starting price was more than $5,500 lower compared to the 2018 model
- A 6-speed Tremec manual and ZF 8-speed automatic remained the sole transmission options

#### Hellcat Redeye (2019)
- Following the discontinuation of the Demon, the Redeye was developed to fill the void
- Essentially a heavily upgraded Hellcat, the Redeye is equipped with a slightly less powerful (due to a smaller hood intake system) Demon engine
- A supercharged 6.2L V8 rated at 797 hp (594 kW) and 707 lb⋅ft (959 N⋅m) of torque, an increase of 90 hp over the standard Hellcat engine
- Other upgrades include reinforced ZF 8 speed automatic transmission, track-tuned suspension, torque Reserve and 41-spline heavy-duty half-shafts, SRT power chiller, and after-run chiller

#### Widebody Package
- For the 2019 model year, buyers could order the SRT Hellcat with the "Widebody Package"
- When purchased, the Challenger gained:
  - Widebody fender flares
  - 20x11-inch Devils Rim forged aluminum wheels
  - 305/35ZR20 Pirelli 3-season performance (P Zero Nero all-season) tires
  - 3-mode Bilstein adaptive damping suspension uniquely tuned for competition use
  - 6-piston calipers with 15.4-inch vented and slotted rotors in the front
  - Stiffened anti-roll bars sized 34mm in front and 22mm rear

#### Final Years (2021-2023)
- For the 2021 model year, Dodge removed the 6-speed Tremec manual transmission option from the Hellcat, making the ZF 8-speed automatic the only transmission choice
- The manual transmission was reintroduced for the 2023 model year, making it the standard gearbox in the final year of production
- On December 22, 2023, the final Dodge Challenger (a Pitch-Black Demon 170) rolled off the assembly line in Brampton, Ontario, marking the end of the Hellcat and all Challenger production

#### SRT Super Stock (2020)
- Slotting in between the Hellcat Redeye and the Demon
- The engine is the same as the Redeye, but is slightly more powerful at 807 hp (602 kW)
- This is enabled by a revision of the powertrain calibration, which increases the redline from 6300 to 6400 rpm
- Additionally, the Super Stock gains lightweight 18-inch wheels with the same drag radials as the Demon, along with a shorter final-drive ratio and drag-optimized suspension tuning

#### SRT Demon 170 (2023)
- Unveiled on March 20, 2023, as the ultimate send-off for the Challenger
- Produces 1,025 hp (764 kW) and 945 lb⋅ft (1,281 N⋅m)
- Has the highest launch force of any production car, with G-forces at 2.004 G's
- Prices starting at $96,666 before destination tax
- Dodge built 3,000 units for the US market and 300 for Canada
- As of 2023, it is the fastest accelerating production car in the world, with a claimed 0-60 mph of 1.66 seconds
- Covers a quarter mile in 8.91 seconds, receiving a ban from the NHRA for setting a sub-nine second quarter mile without a roll cage or parachute
