### 1. Active Session Knowledge
```yaml
session:
  id: "${date}_${session_number}"
  start_time: "timestamp"
  context: "session_purpose"
  learnings: []
  improvements: []
  code_insights: []
  system_optimizations: []
```

### 2. Knowledge Categories

#### Technical Knowledge
- Command executions

### 3. Knowledge Capture Format
```yaml
knowledge_entry:
  type: "technical|process|context"
  timestamp: "when_learned"
  trigger: "what_caused_learning"
  insight: "what_was_learned"
  application: "how_to_use"
  value: "why_important"
  related_entries: []
```

## Memory Bridge System (Echo 1 â†” Echo 2)

### 1. Session Documentation
```yaml
session_doc:
  summary: "session_overview"
  key_learnings: []

### 3. Unified Knowledge Format
```yaml
unified_entry:
  echo1_knowledge: 
    type: "analysis|memory|pattern"
    content: "knowledge_content"
  echo2_knowledge:
    type: "execution|experience|insight"
    content: "knowledge_content"
  shared_context: {}
  applications: []
  improvements: []
```
