## Domain Analysis Highlights

### Key Domain Clusters

2. **Contractor Insurance**: Multiple domains targeting contractor insurance and licensing
3. **Remodeling Insurance**: Commercial and residential remodeling focused domains
4. **Spanish Language**: Two domains targeting Spanish-speaking market
5. **Specialty Insurance**: Niche domains for specific industries/services

### Priority Focus Areas
1. Spray Foam Institute and Licensing (authority site potential)
2. Contractor Insurance Information (educational content)
3. Specialty insurance categories with high keyword value

## Development Strategy
We've organized the domains into strategic development batches, with each batch focused on a specific market segment:

### Batch 1: Spray Foam Cluster
- Create central "institute" site with comprehensive educational content
- Support with regional service sites for lead generation
- Implement blog functionality for industry updates

### Batch 2: Contractor Insurance Education
- Develop educational hub with resources and courses
- Create state-by-state licensing guides
- Implement interactive tools for insurance calculations

### Batch 3: Premium Lead Generation
- Focus on high-value insurance niches
- Develop strong call-to-action focused sites
- Implement quote request functionality

## Implementation Plan
1. Finalize website template with working blog functionality
2. Deploy template across highest priority domains
3. Develop standardized content structure for each website type
4. Create batch development and deployment system

## Files
- [domains-spreadsheet.json](domains-spreadsheet.json): Complete categorized domain list
- [development-batches.md](development-batches.md): Prioritized development batches
- [website-templates.md](website-templates.md): Template system specifications
- [interactive-dashboard.jsx](interactive-dashboard.jsx): React component for managing domains
- [dashboard-usage.jsx](dashboard-usage.jsx): Example usage of the dashboard component

## Next Steps
1. Complete domain categorization for remaining domains in portfolio
2. Finalize website template with blog functionality
3. Create initial content for first batch of domains
4. Develop deployment pipeline for domain websites
5. Implement tracking system for website performance

## Implementation Challenges
The primary challenge identified is developing a working blog system that can use markdown files from GitHub. Previous attempts had difficulties with this functionality. The new website template will focus specifically on ensuring this capability works properly before expanding to additional features.
