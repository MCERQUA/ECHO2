# Hugging Face MCP Integration for Echo2.pages.dev

## Overview
This guide documents the integration of Hugging Face capabilities into the echo2.pages.dev AI chat interface, expanding it beyond GitHub operations to include AI-powered content creation, image generation, document analysis, and more.

## Architecture
```
User → echo2.pages.dev → _worker.js → OpenAI (with HF tools) → Hugging Face Spaces
                                    ↓
                              GitHub Tools (existing)
```

## New Capabilities
1. **Image Generation** - FLUX, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E style models
2. **Document Analysis** - Vision models for OCR and document understanding
3. **Audio Generation** - Text-to-speech and voice synthesis
4. **Model Discovery** - Search and use top models dynamically
5. **Multi-Model Comparison** - Generate with multiple models simultaneously

## Implementation Approach
We're adding Hugging Face tools to the existing OpenAI function calling system. This allows natural conversation like:
- "Generate a logo for my bakery and save it to GitHub"
- "Analyze this invoice and create issues for any problems"
- "Create product photos using the top 3 image models"

## Key Features
- Direct integration with existing OpenAI tools
- Automatic GitHub storage for generated content
- Natural language model selection
- Cost-effective using free HF Spaces
- No infrastructure required

## User Experience
Users continue chatting naturally. The AI automatically:
1. Selects appropriate tools (GitHub vs HF)
2. Chains operations (generate → save)
3. Provides inline results in chat
4. Tracks costs transparently

## Technical Implementation
- Extends OPENAI_TOOLS array with HF functions
- Uses Gradio API endpoints from HF Spaces
- Handles image data as base64 or URLs
- Integrates with existing session management
- Maintains backward compatibility
