## American Motors Corporation Alternatives

Often overlooked in discussions of muscle car history, American Motors Corporation (AMC) produced several compelling performance vehicles that deserve far more recognition than they typically receive. Despite limited resources compared to the Big Three, AMC created distinctive muscle cars that combined impressive performance with unique styling and, in some cases, greater versatility than their competitors. Today, these rare AMC performers represent some of the most distinctive and exclusive options for muscle car collectors.

### AMC Rebel Machine (1970): The Red, White, and Blue Bruiser

In 1970, as the muscle car war reached its peak, AMC made a dramatic statement with The Machine—a purpose-built performance variant of the Rebel sedan that combined patriotic styling with serious horsepower. This limited-production model represented AMC's most focused attempt at creating a pure muscle car and delivered performance that could compete with many of the better-known models from larger manufacturers.

"The Machine was AMC's equivalent of waving a flag and shouting, 'We're here too!'" explains AMC historian Patrick Foster. "It was designed to change perceptions of American Motors as a builder of economy cars and establish legitimate performance credentials for the brand."

#### Engine and Performance

The heart of The Machine was AMC's 390 cubic inch V8, specially tuned to produce 340 horsepower and 430 lb-ft of torque—impressive figures that put it in the same league as many big-block offerings from larger manufacturers. The 390 engine featured:

- High-compression 10.0:1 pistons
- High-performance camshaft
- Four-barrel carburetor
- Functional ram-air induction system
- Dual exhaust with chrome tips
- Heavy-duty cooling system

This potent engine was paired exclusively with a four-speed manual transmission featuring a Hurst shifter. The drivetrain was completed with a heavy-duty rear axle containing 3.54:1 gears (with 3.91:1 optional for maximum acceleration).

The Machine's performance credentials were legitimate, with period testing reporting 0-60 mph times of approximately 6.8 seconds and quarter-mile times in the low 14-second range—figures that could challenge many of the established muscle cars of the era.

#### Distinctive Styling and Features

Perhaps no muscle car made a more dramatic visual statement than the initial version of The Machine, which featured:

- Bright white paint with bold red, white, and blue striping
- Functional ram-air hood scoop
- Hood-mounted tachometer
- Special "The Machine" graphics
- Red, white, and blue headlight bezels
- Styled 15-inch wheels with raised white letter tires

Later in the production run, The Machine became available in other colors, but the patriotic scheme remains the most iconic and collectible version.

Inside, The Machine featured:
- High-back bucket seats
- Center console with Hurst shifter
- Special Machine-turned aluminum trim
- Full instrumentation including tachometer
- Three-spoke steering wheel

#### Performance Enhancements

Beyond the powerful engine, The Machine received substantial chassis and suspension upgrades, including:

- Heavy-duty springs and shock absorbers
- Front and rear sway bars
- Power front disc brakes
- Quick-ratio steering
- Heavy-duty cooling system
- Handling package

These enhancements made The Machine more than just a straight-line performer; it could handle curves with surprising competence for its era.

#### Production and Rarity

AMC produced just 2,326 examples of The Machine during its single-year production run, making it one of the rarer mainstream muscle cars of the era. Of these, experts estimate that approximately 1,000 were built with the distinctive red, white, and blue appearance package, with the remainder featuring various other color options that became available later in the production cycle.

The Machine's limited production and distinctive appearance make it relatively easy to authenticate, though comprehensive documentation is still essential for maximum value. The VIN number and cowl tag provide the primary verification points, with specific engine codes indicating a genuine Machine.

#### Market Position and Value

Despite its rarity, impressive performance, and distinctive styling, The Machine remains surprisingly affordable compared to many muscle cars with similar performance and much higher production numbers. While a comparable 1970 Chevelle SS 396 might command $60,000 to $90,000, a Machine in similar condition typically sells for $45,000 to $75,000, with only the most exceptional examples approaching $100,000.

"The Machine represents one of the most compelling values in the muscle car market," observes collector car appraiser Michael Stevens. "It offers documented performance competitive with many big-block GM and Ford products, much greater rarity, and arguably the most distinctive styling of any muscle car of the era, yet sells for substantially less than many more common models."

This value disparity creates an appealing opportunity for collectors seeking something truly distinctive that still delivers authentic muscle car performance.

### AMC Matador Machine (1971): The Overlooked Evolution

When AMC redesigned its intermediate line for 1971, the Rebel name was replaced by Matador. Along with this change, The Machine evolved into the more subtly styled but still potent Matador Machine. This often-forgotten performer represented AMC's response to changing market conditions while maintaining legitimate performance credentials.

"The Matador Machine reflected the beginning of the shift away from overt muscle cars toward more understated performance vehicles," explains AMC specialist Mark Havlin. "It maintained most of the mechanical specifications of the original Machine but wrapped them in a more conservative package."

#### Engine and Performance

The Matador Machine retained AMC's 390 cubic inch V8, though compression was reduced slightly to 9.5:1 to accommodate lower-octane fuels. Rated output decreased to 330 horsepower and 425 lb-ft of torque—still impressive figures for 1971 as other manufacturers were making more dramatic power reductions.

The 390 in the Matador Machine featured:
- Four-barrel carburetor
- Dual exhaust system
- Performance camshaft
- Ram-air induction system

Transmission options expanded to include:
- Four-speed manual with Hurst shifter
- Automatic transmission (new for 1971)

Despite the slight reduction in rated power, the Matador Machine delivered comparable real-world performance to its predecessor, with 0-60 mph times of approximately 7.0 seconds and quarter-mile times in the mid-14 second range.

#### Distinctive Styling and Features

The Matador Machine featured more subdued styling than its flamboyant predecessor:
- Standard body color paint (no special graphics package)
- Functional ram-air hood scoop
- Dual exhaust with chrome tips
- Styled 15-inch wheels
- Discrete "Machine" badging

Inside, it retained performance-oriented features:
- High-back bucket seats
- Full instrumentation
- Three-spoke steering wheel
- Console with Hurst shifter (with manual transmission)

#### Production and Rarity

The Matador Machine was produced in extremely limited numbers, with experts estimating total production at fewer than 50 units, making it one of the rarest production muscle cars ever built. This limited production was primarily due to changing market conditions, as insurance rates and emission regulations began to impact muscle car sales across the industry.

Documentation for Matador Machines is particularly challenging, as they were not designated by a specific model code but rather as a performance package on the standard Matador. Factory records for these cars are incomplete, making authentication particularly difficult.

#### Market Position and Value

The extreme rarity of the Matador Machine makes market valuation difficult, as examples rarely change hands. When they do appear for sale, documented authentic examples typically command $40,000 to $70,000 depending on condition, with exceptional cars occasionally exceeding $80,000.

"The Matador Machine might be the ultimate sleeper in the muscle car world," suggests vintage AMC dealer Bill Collins. "Most enthusiasts don't even know it existed, yet it offered performance comparable to many better-known muscle cars from 1971. For collectors seeking something truly exclusive, it's hard to imagine a more distinctive choice."

### AMC Ambassador SST (1969-1971): Luxury Muscle from Kenosha

While most muscle car discussions focus on intermediate and pony car platforms, AMC also offered impressive performance in its full-size Ambassador line. The Ambassador SST with the optional 390 V8 represented AMC's entry into the luxury-performance segment, competing with vehicles like the Chrysler 300 and Pontiac Grand Prix.

"The Ambassador SST with the 390 engine was AMC's flagship performance vehicle before the Rebel Machine," explains Patrick Foster. "It combined the company's most powerful engine with its most luxurious interior appointments, creating a sophisticated grand touring experience rather than a stripped-down drag strip warrior."

#### Engine and Performance

When equipped with the optional 390 cubic inch V8, the Ambassador SST produced 325 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque—slightly less than the same engine in The Machine due to different tuning priorities that emphasized refinement and torque at lower RPM.

The 390 in the Ambassador featured:
- Four-barrel carburetor
- Dual exhaust system
- 9.5:1 compression ratio
- Hydraulic lifter camshaft

Transmission options included:
- Three-speed automatic (most common)
- Four-speed manual with floor shifter (rare)
- Three-speed manual (extremely rare)

Despite its luxury orientation and substantial curb weight of approximately 3,900 pounds, the Ambassador 390 delivered respectable performance, with 0-60 mph times of approximately 7.5 seconds and quarter-mile times in the low 16-second range.

#### Distinctive Styling and Features

The Ambassador SST projected an image of refined performance:
- Formal roofline with vinyl top (optional but common)
- Chrome trim and detailed grille
- Full-width taillights
- Styled wheel covers or optional styled steel wheels
- Subtle bodyside moldings

Inside, the SST featured the most luxurious interior available from AMC:
- Leather or premium vinyl seating surfaces
- Woodgrain trim on dashboard and door panels
- Full instrumentation
- Comprehensive sound insulation
- Available air conditioning, power windows, and other luxury features

#### Production and Rarity

While AMC produced approximately 75,000 Ambassadors across all trim levels for the 1969-1971 model years, the SST with 390 engine was relatively uncommon, with experts estimating that perhaps 5-10% were so equipped. Of these, four-speed manual examples were exceedingly rare, with fewer than 100 believed to have been built.

Documentation challenges make authentication difficult for these cars, as production records are not as comprehensive as those for dedicated performance models. The VIN and cowl tag provide the primary verification points.

#### Market Position and Value

The Ambassador SST with 390 engine represents perhaps the greatest value proposition among AMC performance vehicles. While a Machine might command $45,000 to $75,000, a comparable Ambassador SST 390 typically sells for just $15,000 to $35,000, with only the most exceptional examples exceeding $40,000.

"The Ambassador SST 390 offers a unique combination of luxury, performance, and exclusivity at a remarkably affordable price point," notes collector car appraiser Richard Thomas. "For collectors who appreciate the grand touring tradition of muscle cars like the Pontiac Grand Prix or Chrysler 300 but want something truly distinctive, the Ambassador offers compelling value."

### AMC's Unique Approach to Muscle

American Motors' approach to performance vehicles was necessarily different from that of the larger manufacturers. With limited resources for development and marketing, AMC had to be strategic about how it competed in the performance segment.

"AMC couldn't hope to match the comprehensive performance lineups of GM, Ford, and Chrysler," explains automotive historian James Allen. "Instead, they focused on creating distinctive vehicles that offered comparable performance but with unique styling and often greater practicality than competitors."

This focused approach is evident in each of AMC's performance offerings:

- **The Machine** concentrated all of AMC's performance resources into a single, attention-grabbing model with legitimate muscle car credentials.

- **The Matador Machine** adapted to changing market conditions while maintaining performance capabilities.

- **The Ambassador SST 390** provided a sophisticated alternative to traditional muscle cars, emphasizing comfort and refinement without sacrificing too much performance.

What these vehicles shared was a distinctive character that set them apart from the mainstream muscle cars of the era. While they may have lacked the marketing muscle and racing heritage of their competitors from larger manufacturers, they offered comparable performance with greater exclusivity and, in many cases, more practical features.

Today, these rare AMC performers offer enthusiasts the opportunity to own genuinely distinctive muscle cars that stand out at any gathering. As collector Jim Rogers, owner of both a Machine and a Chevelle SS 396, observes, "When I take both cars to a show, the Chevelle might get appreciative nods from people who've seen dozens just like it, but The Machine draws crowds of people who've never seen one in person. That kind of exclusivity is increasingly valuable in a hobby where standing out matters."

**Feature Box: "Group 19: AMC's Performance Parts Division"**

While AMC couldn't match the racing budgets of larger manufacturers, it did create a performance parts program known as "Group 19" that developed and marketed speed equipment for AMC vehicles. Named after the internal accounting code used to track the program, Group 19 offered a range of performance upgrades for AMC engines and chassis.

Key Group 19 components included:

- **Cross-Ram intake manifold**: Designed for dual four-barrel carburetors, this intake manifold could boost the 390 V8's output by approximately 40-50 horsepower.

- **Free-flow exhaust headers**: These tubular headers significantly improved exhaust flow compared to the cast iron manifolds used on production vehicles.

- **High-performance camshafts**: Several profiles were available, ranging from mild street cams to aggressive racing designs.

- **Heavy-duty valve springs and pushrods**: Essential for high-RPM operation with performance camshafts.

- **Aluminum flywheel**: Reduced rotating mass for quicker acceleration.

- **Dual-point distributor**: Provided more consistent ignition timing at high RPM.

While Group 19 parts were ostensibly developed for racing applications, many found their way onto street vehicles through dealer installation or owner modification. Some dealers, like Wisconsin's Randall AMC, specialized in creating turnkey performance packages using Group 19 components, creating their own mini-legends within AMC circles.

The existence of Group 19 demonstrates that despite its resource limitations, AMC was seriously committed to performance and provided enthusiasts with the tools to extract maximum potential from their vehicles—a legacy that continues to benefit collectors of these distinctive machines today.
