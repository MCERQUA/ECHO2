# URGENT: Echo Communication Terminal Fix - Action Required

## What I Fixed
I've identified and fixed the issue with the Echo Communication Terminal being stuck on the initialization screen. The problem was that Cloudflare Pages wasn't correctly deploying the worker functions.

## What You Need to Do NOW

### 1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard
Visit: https://dash.cloudflare.com/

### 2. Navigate to Pages
- Click on "Pages" in the left sidebar
- Find and click on "echo2"

### 3. Add Environment Variables
Go to Settings > Environment variables and add:
- **OPENAI_API_KEY**: Your OpenAI API key (get it from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- **GITHUB_TOKEN**: Your GitHub personal access token (get it from https://github.com/settings/tokens)

### 4. Configure Build Settings (if needed)
Go to Settings > Builds & deployments:
- Build command: (leave empty)
- Build output directory: `projects/active/ai-github-interface/frontend`
- Root directory (advanced): `/`

### 5. Trigger a New Deployment
Either:
- Wait for automatic deployment (triggered by the commits I just made)
- OR manually trigger: Go to Deployments tab > "Retry deployment" on the latest one

### 6. Verify It's Working
After deployment completes (2-3 minutes):
1. Visit: https://echo2.pages.dev/api/health
   - Should return JSON with "status": "healthy"
2. Visit: https://echo2.pages.dev
   - Should show "Neural Link Active" instead of stuck on initialization

## What Changed
- Created `functions/_worker.js` with all API endpoints
- This follows Cloudflare Pages Functions structure
- Includes OpenAI integration with cost-effective gpt-4.1-nano model
- Session persistence with 24-hour memory
- GitHub tool integration

## If It Still Doesn't Work
1. Check that environment variables are set correctly
2. Check deployment logs in Cloudflare Pages dashboard
3. Make sure you're looking at the latest deployment
4. Try clearing your browser cache and refreshing

The deployment should happen automatically from the GitHub commits I made, but you MUST add the environment variables for it to work!
