## Progress Tracking System
- **Status Categories:**
  - 🔴 Not Started
  - 🟡 Research Phase
  - 🟢 Completed
  - 🔄 Under Review
  - ⚠️ Needs Update

## Efficiency Strategy

### 1. Research Phase
- Conduct web research first (URL validation and content gathering)
- Create state-specific research documents
- Tag useful information for content generation
- Store verified URLs and notes in structured format

### 2. Content Generation
#### Batch Processing Approach
- Group states by similarity in requirements
- Create batched prompts for similar states
- Utilize delayed batch API calls for cost efficiency
- Structure: 5-10 states per batch based on commonality

### 3. Quality Control
- Post-generation verification checklist
- Cross-reference with source materials
- Consistency check across states
- SEO optimization verification

## Research Template
```markdown
### [State Name] Research Notes

#### Key Requirements
- [ ] Licensing Requirements
- [ ] Bonding Requirements
- [ ] Insurance Requirements
- [ ] Special Considerations

#### Verified Sources
1. [Source Name](URL)
   - Last Verified: [Date]
   - Key Information: [Brief]

#### Additional Opportunities
- [ ] Related Services
- [ ] State-Specific Programs
- [ ] Local Requirements
```

## Batch Processing Strategy
1. **Research Collection Phase**
   - Complete research for 5-10 states
   - Organize common requirements
   - Prepare structured data

2. **Batch Generation**
   - Create templated prompts
   - Schedule batch API calls
   - Process similar states together

3. **Cost Optimization**
   - Utilize off-peak processing
   - Combine similar state requirements
   - Reuse common sections

## Enhancement Opportunities
- Interactive requirement checklist
- PDF downloads of requirements
- Local contractor directories
- Seasonal requirement updates
- Cost calculator integration
- State-specific FAQ sections

## Notes System
Each state folder includes:
1. Initial Research Notes
2. Content Generation Notes
3. Verification Notes
4. Enhancement Suggestions

## Quality Metrics
- Source citation accuracy
- Information currentness
- Readability score
- SEO optimization
- Mobile responsiveness
- Internal linking structure

## Implementation Steps
1. Set up directory structure
2. Create templates
3. Begin research phase
4. Develop batch processing queue
5. Generate content in batches
6. Implement review process
7. Deploy and monitor

## Future Considerations
- Regular update schedule
- Compliance monitoring
- User feedback integration
- Analytics tracking
- Content expansion opportunities

## API Usage Optimization
- Batch similar requests
- Schedule during off-peak
- Cache reusable components
- Implement rate limiting
- Monitor token usage

## Progress Updates
| State | Status | Research | Content | Review | Notes |
|-------|---------|-----------|----------|---------|--------|
| [First Batch - TBD] | 🔴 | - | - | - | - |
