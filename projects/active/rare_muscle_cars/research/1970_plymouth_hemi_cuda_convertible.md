# 1970 Plymouth Hemi 'Cuda Convertible

## Historical Context

The 1970 Plymouth Hemi 'Cuda Convertible represents the pinnacle of Chrysler's muscle car era and is widely considered one of the holy grails of muscle car collecting. It arrived at the absolute peak of the muscle car era, when performance was the primary selling point and before emissions regulations, insurance premiums, and the oil crisis dramatically altered the automotive landscape.

The 'Cuda was Plymouth's high-performance version of the Barracuda, which was completely redesigned for the 1970 model year. This redesign included a move to the Chrysler E-body platform shared with the Dodge Challenger. This platform allowed Plymouth to finally install the massive 426 Hemi engine in the Barracuda without major modifications.

The timing of the 1970 Hemi 'Cuda Convertible was critical - it represented the height of the muscle car era just before its rapid decline. By 1971, compression ratios were being lowered across the industry, and by 1972 many high-performance options were being eliminated entirely.

## Production Details and Rarity Factors

The 1970 Plymouth Hemi 'Cuda Convertible is one of the rarest and most valuable muscle cars ever produced, with only **14 units** ever built for the U.S. market and **3 units** for export (to Canada), for a total of just **17 examples** worldwide.

### Production Breakdown:
- **Total 1970 Barracudas**: 55,499
- **Total 1970 'Cudas**: Approximately 18,690
- **Total 1970 'Cuda Convertibles**: 635
- **Hemi 'Cuda Convertibles**: 14 U.S. + 3 export = 17 total

### Transmission Breakdown of the 17 Hemi 'Cuda Convertibles:
- **Automatic Transmission**: 9 units
- **4-Speed Manual Transmission**: 8 units

### Color Distribution:
- FC7 In-Violet (Plum Crazy): 2
- EV2 TorRed: 3
- FJ5 Limelight: 1
- EW1 Alpine White: 3
- FE5 Rallye Red: 2
- FY1 Lemon Twist: 1
- EB5 Blue Fire Metallic: 1
- EF8 Ivy Green: 1
- Black: 1
- Triple Black (black exterior, top, and interior): 1
- Black with white interior: 1

### Rarity Factors:
1. Extremely low production numbers
2. High original cost limited sales (the Hemi option added $871 to the base price - approximately 18% of the car's total cost)
3. Poor fuel economy made them impractical for daily use
4. High insurance premiums specifically targeted high-performance vehicles
5. The Hemi engine required more maintenance than standard V8s
6. Many were modified for racing and subsequently damaged or destroyed

## Authentication Challenges

Authenticating a genuine 1970 Hemi 'Cuda Convertible is extremely challenging due to several factors:

1. **VIN Decoding**: The VIN alone doesn't confirm a Hemi car. The 1970 model VIN pattern is:
   - BS27R0B******
   - BS = Plymouth Barracuda Special
   - 27 = Convertible body
   - R = 426 Hemi engine
   - 0 = 1970 model year
   - B = Hamtramck, MI assembly plant
   - ****** = Sequential production number

2. **Fender Tag/Broadcast Sheet**: Critical for authentication. Located on the inner driver's side fender well. Must show:
   - E74 = 426 Hemi engine
   - D21 = Heavy-duty 4-speed manual or D32 = Heavy-duty automatic

3. **Hidden VIN Locations**: Genuine cars have VINs in multiple hidden locations that match the dashboard VIN.

4. **Body Stampings**: Unique stampings on body panels specific to Hemi cars.

5. **Surviving Documentation**: Original window sticker, build sheet, dealer invoice, or Chrysler Registry documentation.

6. **Numbers Matching**: Engine, transmission, and rear end should have appropriate date codes and part numbers.

7. **Proper Components**: Hemi-specific parts like:
   - Special K-member for Hemi mounting
   - Modified shock towers
   - Unique transmission tunnel (for manual cars)
   - Special torque converters (for automatic cars)
   
8. **Common Counterfeiting Issues**:
   - Clone cars built from standard 'Cuda Convertibles
   - Fake fender tags or broadcast sheets
   - Re-stamped engine blocks
   - Incorrectly restored components
   - Converted hardtops (although this requires substantial metalwork)

Due to the value of authentic cars ($2-4+ million), proper authentication often requires multiple Mopar experts, extensive documentation research, and forensic inspection of stampings, markings, and paint.

## Current Market Valuation

The 1970 Plymouth Hemi 'Cuda Convertible is among the most valuable muscle cars ever produced, with values that rival European exotics. Recent sales and current market estimates as of 2025:

### Recent Auction Results:
- Mecum Auctions, 2024: $3.8 million (4-speed, In-Violet)
- RM Sotheby's, 2023: $3.45 million (automatic, Alpine White)
- Barrett-Jackson, 2022: $3.95 million (4-speed, TorRed)
- Mecum Auctions, 2021: $4.8 million (one of three 4-speed examples with build sheet)

### Valuation Factors:
1. **Transmission**: 4-speed manual examples typically command a 20-25% premium over automatics
2. **Documentation**: Cars with original build sheets, window stickers, or original purchase documentation command significant premiums
3. **Color Combination**: Rare or desirable color combinations (especially High Impact colors) increase value
4. **Options**: Rare options like the Shaker hood, interior packages, and performance equipment add value
5. **Originality**: Numbers-matching, unrestored examples with original components command the highest prices
6. **Ownership History**: Documented history with notable owners can increase value
7. **Awards**: Show winners with prestigious awards demand higher prices

### Current Market Value Ranges (2025):
- Museum-quality, fully-documented examples: $3.8-5.2 million
- Well-restored, numbers-matching examples: $3.2-3.8 million
- Non-numbers matching or significantly modified examples: $1.8-2.8 million

The market for these cars has shown remarkable resilience even during economic downturns, as they are considered blue-chip collectibles. However, the buyer pool at this price point is extremely small, making individual sales highly variable based on the specific buyers present.

## Insurance Considerations

Insuring a multi-million dollar 1970 Hemi 'Cuda Convertible presents unique challenges:

## Expert Perspectives

Insights from recognized Mopar experts on the 1970 Hemi 'Cuda Convertible:

### Galen Govier (Renowned Mopar Authenticator):
"The 1970 Hemi 'Cuda Convertible represents the perfect storm of rarity, performance, and historical significance. What makes authentication challenging is the combination of extremely high value and the fact that Chrysler's documentation wasn't always consistent. I've personally verified only 12 of the 17 cars as still existing."

### Roger Gibson (Premier Mopar Restorer):
"Restoring these cars presents unique challenges due to Hemi-specific components that were never reproduced properly. The convertible structure also required special reinforcements to handle the torque of the Hemi. A proper restoration requires sourcing NOS parts that are practically unobtainable today."

### Colin Comer (Author and Muscle Car Expert):
"The 1970 Hemi 'Cuda Convertible has transcended being merely a collector car and has become an investment-grade asset. Unlike many muscle cars that disappeared during the 1970s and 1980s, the survival rate of these 17 cars is remarkably high due to their recognition as special even when new."

### Steve Lehto (Automotive Historian):
"What's fascinating about the Hemi 'Cuda Convertible is that it was a commercial failure in its time - too expensive, too impractical - but that commercial failure created the perfect conditions for its legendary status today. Almost no one bought them new, which is precisely why they're worth millions now."

### Frank Badalson (Mopar Collector):
"The market for these cars exists in its own economy, largely disconnected from other muscle cars or even other Mopars. Buyers at this level aren't just purchasing a car; they're acquiring a centerpiece for a collection that represents the absolute pinnacle of American automotive performance history."
