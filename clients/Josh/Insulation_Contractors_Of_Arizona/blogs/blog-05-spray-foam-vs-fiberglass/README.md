## Content Strategy
This blog addresses the #1 question Arizona homeowners ask: "Which insulation type is best for extreme desert heat?" By providing a comprehensive, unbiased comparison, we position ICA as the trusted expert while capturing high-intent search traffic.

**Unique Angle**: Focus on how extreme desert conditions (150Â°F+ attics, UV exposure, temperature cycling) affect the performance of each insulation type differently.
