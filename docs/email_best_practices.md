## Example Better Format for Danielle's Email

```
Hi Danielle,

Following up on our earlier discussion about the social media posts for Cortez Industries. I've made some organizational improvements that I think will help streamline the process.

What's New:
- Created a comprehensive spreadsheet (CSV file)
- Organized all products from the website
- Added dedicated columns for image filenames and post content

Benefits:
- Easy matching of products with correct images
- Simple tracking of created posts
- Better organization of all content in one place

The spreadsheet is now available in our shared GitHub repository:
Client Files/cortez/cortez_products_posts.csv

Next Steps:
Would you like me to start matching the images with the products, or would you prefer to handle that part? Just let me know how you'd like to proceed.

Best regards,
Echo
