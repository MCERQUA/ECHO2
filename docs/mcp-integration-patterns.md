# MCP Integration Patterns

This document outlines the patterns and best practices for integrating the GitHub repository with the Knowledge Graph MCP, creating a unified approach to Echo's identity and memory management.

## Knowledge-to-Repository References

### Entity-to-File Pattern
When referencing files in the repository from the knowledge graph:

```
Entity: "Project X"
Observation: "Documentation available at https://github.com/MCERQUA/ECHO2/tree/main/projects/active/project-x"
```

### Knowledge Tier Mapping
Mapping knowledge tiers to repository structure:

| Knowledge Tier | Repository Location |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Tier 1: Core Identity | letter-to-echo2.md, system_state.json |
| Tier 2: Active Projects | projects/active/* |
| Tier 3: Reference Knowledge | knowledge/*, docs/* |
| Tier 4: Archive | projects/archive/* |

## Repository-to-Knowledge References

### File Header Pattern
Each significant file should include a header that references relevant knowledge entities:

```markdown
---
title: Project X Implementation
knowledge_entities: 
  - Project_X
  - Implementation_Pattern_Y
  - Client_Z
tier: 2
last_updated: 2025-03-08
---
```

### Commit Message Pattern
Commit messages should reference knowledge entities when applicable:

```
Update Project X documentation [entities: Project_X, Client_Z]
```

## Synchronization Patterns

### Identity Synchronization
Core identity information should be consistently represented in both systems:

1. Knowledge Graph: Core identity entity with comprehensive observations
2. Repository: letter-to-echo2.md and system_state.json as primary identity records

### Project Synchronization
For each active project:

1. Knowledge Graph: Entity with project details and observations
2. Repository: Directory in projects/active with implementation details
3. Cross-references in both directions

### Memory Synchronization
Memory and learning patterns:

1. Knowledge Graph: Observations added to relevant entities
2. Repository: Updates to session-learnings.md and project-specific logs
3. Periodic reconciliation to ensure consistency

## Implementation Guidelines

### When to Use GitHub Repository
- Code storage and version control
- Public-facing documentation
- Project implementations and templates
- Client deliverables
- Technical artifacts

### When to Use Knowledge Graph
- Identity maintenance
- Relationship tracking
- Context awareness
- Memory persistence
- Query capabilities

### Hybrid Approaches
- Use knowledge graph for relationship understanding
- Use repository for content storage
- Create clear references between systems
- Maintain synchronization with explicit update mechanisms

## Future Development

1. Automated synchronization between systems
2. Enhanced reference patterns with direct entity linking
3. User interface for browsing repository through knowledge graph
4. Image and binary file management strategies

By following these patterns, Echo can maintain a consistent identity and memory across implementations while leveraging the strengths of both systems.
