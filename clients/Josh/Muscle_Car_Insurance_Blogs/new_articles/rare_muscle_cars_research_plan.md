# Research Plan: 10 Rare Muscle Cars Built in Low Numbers

## Overview
This research plan outlines the approach for creating a comprehensive article on rare muscle cars produced in limited quantities. The article will expand upon a basic slideshow format, adding substantial value through detailed production statistics, historical context, technical specifications, market valuations, and insurance considerations.

## Original Source Analysis
- **Source URL**: MSN slideshow on rare muscle cars
- **Content Type**: Slideshow/Gallery format
- **Deficiencies**:
  - Limited technical specifications for each vehicle
  - Minimal historical context for production limitations
  - Lack of production verification from multiple sources
  - No auction result history or valuation analysis
  - No insurance considerations for rare collector vehicles
  - No sourcing for production claims

## Research Focus Areas

### 1. Vehicle Selection & Production Verification
- Verify claimed production numbers through multiple authoritative sources
- Research factory documentation, production records, and registry data
- Consult manufacturer archives and recognized model experts
- Document specific trim/option packages that contribute to rarity
- Research regional/dealer special editions not widely documented

### 2. Historical Context
- Research the business conditions affecting limited production runs
- Identify labor strikes, material shortages, or corporate decisions
- Document competitive market pressures influencing production
- Research design/engineering challenges that limited certain models
- Identify regulatory factors affecting production feasibility

### 3. Technical Specifications
- Document engine specifications, performance data, and drivetrain options
- Research factory testing data and period magazine test results
- Compile weight, dimensions, and chassis/suspension details
- Document special components and materials used in limited editions
- Research factory modifications specific to rare variants

### 4. Market Valuation & Trends
- Research auction results for each model over the past 5-10 years
- Document condition ratings and their impact on valuations
- Analyze price appreciation patterns compared to common models
- Research private sales data where available

### 5. Authentication Challenges
- Research documentation standards for verifying each model
- Document common reproduction/clone issues for each vehicle
- Identify key authentication points for determining originality
- Research registry requirements and authentication processes

### 6. Ownership & Insurance Considerations
- Research specialized insurance needs for ultra-rare vehicles
- Document storage requirements that affect insurance ratings
- Research driving vs. preservation considerations
- Compile transportation and security requirements
- Document standard appraisal procedures for insurance purposes
