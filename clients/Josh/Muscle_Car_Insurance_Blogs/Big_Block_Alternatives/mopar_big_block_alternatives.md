## Chrysler Corporation Big-Block Alternatives

While Dodge Chargers, Plymouth Road Runners, and Cuda models dominate Mopar muscle car discussions, Chrysler Corporation produced several alternative big-block performance vehicles that deserve far more attention than they typically receive. From luxury-oriented full-size models to intermediate sleepers, these overlooked Mopars offered the same legendary powertrains as their more famous siblings, often with greater exclusivity and distinctive features.

### Plymouth Sport Fury GT (1970-1971): The Gentleman's Muscle Car

As Plymouth's full-size offering, the Sport Fury GT represented a sophisticated approach to performance that balanced comfort with impressive capability. While Road Runners and GTXs grabbed magazine covers and drag strip glory, the Sport Fury GT provided a more mature muscle car experience without sacrificing the thrilling acceleration provided by Mopar's potent big-block engines.

"The Sport Fury GT was Plymouth's answer to the Pontiac Grand Prix and Ford XL," explains Mopar historian Jim Schild. "It combined the raw power of a true muscle car with the interior comfort and road manners of a luxury coupe."

#### Engine and Performance

The Sport Fury GT came standard with Chrysler's formidable 440 cubic inch V8 in "Super Commando" tune, producing 375 horsepower and 480 lb-ft of torque. This was the same basic engine installed in Road Runners and GTXs, delivering comparable performance despite the Fury's larger dimensions and greater weight.

The 440 Super Commando featured:
- Carter AVS four-barrel carburetor
- Dual exhaust system
- 10.1:1 compression ratio
- Hydraulic lifter camshaft

Transmission options included:
- TorqueFlite three-speed automatic (most common)
- Four-speed manual with Hurst shifter (rare)

Despite weighing approximately 4,200 pounds—about 400 pounds more than a Road Runner—the Sport Fury GT could accelerate from 0-60 mph in approximately 6.6 seconds and complete the quarter-mile in the mid-14 second range, impressive figures that could surprise many owners of smaller muscle cars.

Unlike other Plymouth performance models, the Fury GT was never offered with the 426 Hemi engine, maintaining its position as a balance of luxury and performance rather than an all-out drag strip warrior.

#### Distinctive Styling and Features

The Sport Fury GT announced its performance potential through several visual cues:

- Performance hood with simulated air intakes
- Special "GT" badging on grille and rear deck
- Unique sport stripe package
- Styled road wheels (15-inch)
- Bright exhaust tips

Inside, the GT offered a level of luxury uncommon in muscle cars:
- High-back bucket seats with center console
- Woodgrain instrument panel
- Full instrumentation including 150-mph speedometer
- Three-spoke steering wheel
- Optional air conditioning (common on GT models)

For 1971, Plymouth retained the Sport Fury GT with minor styling changes and slightly reduced compression ratios to accommodate low-lead gasoline.

#### Production and Rarity

The Sport Fury GT was produced in relatively limited numbers compared to Plymouth's other performance models:
- 1970: Approximately 6,800 units
- 1971: Fewer than 5,000 units (exact records unavailable)

Of these, four-speed manual examples were exceedingly rare, with experts estimating that fewer than 10% of Sport Fury GTs were so equipped.

Documentation challenges make authentication difficult for these cars, as factory records for full-size Plymouths aren't as complete as those for their more performance-oriented models. The broadcast sheet (when available) and fender tag provide the most reliable verification of a genuine GT.

#### Market Position and Value

In today's collector market, the Sport Fury GT represents one of the most compelling values in Mopar performance. While a 1970 Plymouth GTX with the 440 engine might command $60,000 to $90,000 for a quality example, a comparable Sport Fury GT typically sells for $25,000 to $45,000, with only the most exceptional examples approaching $60,000.

"The Sport Fury GT might be the most undervalued Mopar performance car," observes collector car appraiser Thomas Wilson. "You get essentially the same engine and performance as a GTX with greater exclusivity and luxury appointments at less than half the price. For collectors who actually enjoy driving their muscle cars, the Sport Fury GT offers a more comfortable and practical experience without sacrificing the emotional thrill of big-block Mopar power."

The value gap is even more pronounced when comparing current prices to original MSRPs. When new, the Sport Fury GT cost approximately $300-400 more than a comparably equipped GTX, reflecting its more upscale positioning. Today's market has inverted this relationship dramatically.

### Dodge Coronet R/T (1967-1970): Overshadowed by Its Own Siblings

In the late 1960s, Dodge created one of the most comprehensive performance lineups in the industry. While the Charger and Challenger receive most of the attention today, the Coronet R/T (Road/Track) established the template for Dodge performance and offered the same potent engines in a slightly more practical and affordable package.

"The Coronet R/T was actually Dodge's first modern muscle car, predating the more famous Charger R/T," explains Mopar expert David Hakim. "It established the formula that would define Dodge performance for years: big engines, distinctive styling, and focused performance upgrades."

#### Engine and Performance

The Coronet R/T came standard with Chrysler's 440 cubic inch "Magnum" V8, producing 375 horsepower and 480 lb-ft of torque. For those seeking ultimate performance, the legendary 426 Hemi was optional, delivering an advertised 425 horsepower and 490 lb-ft of torque (widely believed to be underrated for insurance purposes).

The 440 Magnum featured:
- Carter AFB four-barrel carburetor
- Dual exhaust system
- 10.1:1 compression ratio
- Solid lifter camshaft

The 426 Hemi added:
- Dual Carter AFB four-barrel carburetors
- Hemispherical combustion chambers
- 10.25:1 compression ratio
- Special valve train with dual rocker arm shafts

Transmission options included:
- TorqueFlite three-speed automatic
- Four-speed manual with Hurst shifter

Performance was exceptional for the era, with 440-powered Coronet R/Ts capable of 0-60 mph in approximately 6.5 seconds and quarter-mile times in the mid-14 second range. Hemi models could dip into the high 13s, making them among the quickest production cars of their time.

#### Distinctive Styling and Features

The Coronet R/T featured several visual cues that distinguished it from standard Coronets:

- Unique grille design with R/T badging
- Simulated hood scoops (1967-1968) or performance hood with scoops (1969-1970)
- Distinctive bodyside striping or bumblebee stripes on rear
- Dual exhaust with chrome tips
- Special wheel covers or optional styled road wheels

Inside, the R/T offered:
- Bucket seats with center console (optional but common)
- Woodgrain instrument panel
- Rally instrument cluster with tachometer
- Three-spoke steering wheel

The 1969-1970 models featured more aggressive styling with a prominent power bulge hood and revised grille and taillight designs.

#### Production and Rarity

The Coronet R/T was produced in significant numbers during its four-year run, though production declined steadily as the Charger gained popularity:

- 1967: 10,077 units
- 1968: 10,558 units
- 1969: 7,238 units
- 1970: 2,319 units

Hemi-powered Coronet R/Ts were exceedingly rare throughout the production run:
- 1967: 339 units
- 1968: 230 units
- 1969: 108 units
- 1970: Fewer than 50 units

After 1970, the Coronet R/T was discontinued as Dodge consolidated its performance offerings.

#### Market Position and Value

The value disparity between Coronet R/Ts and their Charger siblings represents one of the most compelling opportunities in the muscle car market. While a 1969 Charger R/T with the 440 Magnum might command $80,000 to $120,000 for a quality example, a comparable Coronet R/T typically sells for $45,000 to $75,000, despite sharing the same powertrain, similar performance, and in many cases, lower production numbers.

For Hemi cars, the disparity is even more dramatic. A 1969 Hemi Charger might sell for $175,000 to $300,000, while a Hemi Coronet R/T from the same year might bring $140,000 to $200,000.

"The Coronet R/T offers perhaps the best value proposition in Mopar muscle," suggests auction specialist Michael Morgan. "You get the same engines, same performance, and comparable build quality as Chargers and Challengers at a substantial discount. For enthusiasts who focus on the driving experience rather than maximum investment potential or movie car status, the Coronet R/T represents an extraordinary opportunity."

### Chrysler 300 Hurst (1970): The Ultimate Luxury Muscle Car

In 1970, Chrysler collaborated with Hurst Performance Products to create one of the most intriguing and exclusive muscle cars of the era: the 300 Hurst. This limited-production model combined Chrysler's top-of-the-line luxury with serious performance hardware to create a unique grand touring machine that had few peers in the American market.

"The 300 Hurst was a modern interpretation of the legendary 'letter series' 300s that had defined Chrysler performance in the 1950s and early 1960s," explains 300 historian Mark Worman. "It offered a level of luxury that most muscle cars couldn't match, combined with performance that could humble many purpose-built performers."

#### Engine and Performance

The 300 Hurst was powered by Chrysler's 440 TNT (Torque 'N' Timing) V8, producing 375 horsepower and 480 lb-ft of torque. This was the same basic engine used in other Mopar performance cars, but in the 300 Hurst, it was paired exclusively with the TorqueFlite three-speed automatic transmission.

Performance equipment included:
- Carter AVS four-barrel carburetor
- Dual exhaust system
- 10.1:1 compression ratio
- Performance camshaft
- Heavy-duty cooling system

Despite its luxury orientation and substantial curb weight of approximately 4,400 pounds, the 300 Hurst delivered impressive performance, with 0-60 mph times of approximately 7.1 seconds and quarter-mile times in the mid-14 second range.

#### Distinctive Styling and Features

The 300 Hurst featured one of the most distinctive appearances of any muscle car, with a unique white and gold color scheme designed by Hurst:
- Spinnaker White base paint
- Satin Tan (gold) fiberglass hood with functional air scoop
- Gold accent stripes along the sides
- Gold painted trunk lid and rear deck
- Special 300H medallions

Perhaps the most distinctive feature was the trunk-mounted rear spoiler with integrated rear-facing light bar—a feature that presaged modern high-mounted brake lights by decades.

The luxury-oriented interior featured:
- Leather front bucket seats with integrated headrests
- Full-length console
- Wood-grain trim
- Hurst Shifter (despite the automatic transmission)
- Full instrumentation
- Standard air conditioning
- Power windows and seats

#### Production and Rarity

The 300 Hurst was produced for a single model year with just 501 units manufactured, making it one of the rarest production muscle cars of the era. Each car featured a numbered dash plaque indicating its place in the production sequence.

The limited production and distinctive appearance make the 300 Hurst relatively easy to authenticate, though some unscrupulous sellers have created clones from standard 300 models over the years. The numbered dash plaque and specific VIN sequence are the primary verification points.

#### Market Position and Value

Despite its rarity, sophisticated engineering, and distinctive styling, the 300 Hurst remains surprisingly affordable compared to other limited-production Mopar performance cars. While a Plymouth Superbird might command $200,000 to $400,000, the much rarer 300 Hurst typically sells for $40,000 to $80,000, with only the most exceptional examples approaching $100,000.

"The 300 Hurst might be the most underappreciated limited-production Mopar," observes collector car insurance specialist James Wilson. "It's significantly rarer than a Superbird, offers comparable performance to many pure muscle cars, and provides a level of luxury and exclusivity that few other performance cars of the era can match, yet it sells for a fraction of what other rare Mopars command."

This value disparity creates an appealing opportunity for collectors seeking something truly distinctive that still delivers an authentic muscle car experience.

### Dodge Polara 500 (1968-1970): The Forgotten Flagship

While the Coronet and Charger dominated Dodge's performance image, the division's full-size Polara offered big-block power in a more substantial package. The Polara 500 sport model combined aggressive styling with comfort and, when properly equipped, impressive acceleration that could surprise many owners of dedicated muscle cars.

"The Polara 500 was Dodge's answer to the Impala SS and Ford XL models," explains Mopar historian David Wise. "It offered serious performance for buyers who wanted something more substantial than an intermediate but still demanded muscle car capabilities."

#### Engine and Performance

The Polara 500 offered a range of engines, but the most potent was the 440 cubic inch V8 producing 375 horsepower and 480 lb-ft of torque—the same engine found in Dodge's more famous muscle cars. Unlike most full-size competitors, the Polara 500 could even be ordered with the legendary 426 Hemi engine in 1968 and 1969, though very few were built with this option.

The 440 in the Polara featured:
- Carter four-barrel carburetor
- 10.1:1 compression ratio
- Dual exhaust
- Performance camshaft

Transmission options included:
- TorqueFlite three-speed automatic (most common)
- Four-speed manual with Hurst shifter (rare)

Despite weighing approximately 4,200 pounds, a 440-powered Polara 500 could accelerate from 0-60 mph in about 7.0 seconds and run the quarter-mile in the mid-15 second range—impressive figures for a full-size luxury-oriented model.

#### Distinctive Styling and Features

The Polara 500 featured sportier styling than standard Polaras:
- Special grille treatment
- Unique side stripes
- "500" badging on grille and fenders
- Simulated hood scoops
- Standard wheel covers with optional styled road wheels

Inside, the Polara 500 offered:
- Bucket seats with center console (optional)
- Special instrument panel with full gauges
- Three-spoke steering wheel
- Woodgrain accent trim
- Available convenience features such as power windows and air conditioning

#### Production and Rarity

The Polara 500 was produced in moderate numbers, though specific production figures for 440-equipped models are not well documented:
- 1968: Approximately 18,000 Polara 500s (all engines)
- 1969: Approximately 15,000 Polara 500s (all engines)
- 1970: Approximately 7,800 Polara 500s (all engines)

Of these, experts estimate that perhaps 10-15% were equipped with the 440 engine, with four-speed manual transmissions being exceedingly rare. Hemi Polaras are among the rarest Mopar muscle cars, with fewer than 20 believed to have been built across 1968 and 1969.

#### Market Position and Value

The Polara 500 represents perhaps the greatest value proposition among big-block Mopars. While a Coronet or Charger with the 440 engine might command $60,000 to $100,000, a comparable Polara 500 typically sells for just $20,000 to $40,000, with only the most exceptional examples exceeding $50,000.

"The Polara 500 offers the same legendary Mopar powertrain as the more famous muscle cars at a fraction of the price," notes collector car appraiser Richard Thomas. "For collectors who appreciate the driving experience rather than just investment potential, the Polara 500 provides authentic big-block performance with greater comfort and practicality than smaller muscle cars."

### Mopar's Comprehensive Performance Strategy

Chrysler Corporation's approach to performance in the late 1960s and early 1970s was remarkably democratic, offering big-block power across multiple divisions, price points, and vehicle sizes. From compact Darts and Barracudas to full-size Polaras and New Yorkers, potent 383, 440, and occasionally even 426 Hemi engines found their way into a diverse array of vehicles.

This comprehensive approach created a rich tapestry of performance options beyond the headline-grabbing Road Runners, Chargers, and 'Cudas. What made Chrysler's strategy particularly interesting was the consistency of its powertrains across models—the 440 Magnum/Super Commando and 426 Hemi engines were essentially identical whether installed in a Road Runner, a Coronet R/T, or a Chrysler 300, delivering comparable performance adjusted only for the vehicle's weight and gearing.

Today, this engine consistency creates compelling value opportunities for collectors. The same 440 that powers a six-figure GTX can be enjoyed in a $30,000 Sport Fury GT or Polara 500, delivering a similar driving experience at a fraction of the cost. For enthusiasts who prioritize the visceral experience of muscle car performance over maximum investment potential or show circuit status, these alternative Mopars represent some of the most appealing options in the collector market.

As Mopar specialist Mike Goldberg observes, "The beauty of Chrysler's performance strategy was its consistency and pervasiveness throughout the lineup. Almost any model could be ordered with serious performance equipment, creating a democracy of power that's reflected in today's collector market. Smart collectors are increasingly recognizing the appeal of these overlooked models, appreciating their combination of authentic muscle car performance with greater exclusivity and value."

**Feature Box: "The 440 Magnum/Super Commando/TNT: One Engine, Three Names"**

One of the fascinating aspects of Chrysler Corporation's muscle car strategy was its brand-specific naming for essentially identical engines. The 440 cubic inch big-block V8 that powered so many high-performance Mopars carried different names depending on which division's vehicle it was installed in:

- **440 Magnum**: Used in Dodge models like the Charger, Coronet R/T, and Super Bee
- **440 Super Commando**: Used in Plymouth models like the Road Runner, GTX, and Sport Fury GT
- **440 TNT** (Torque 'N' Timing): Used in Chrysler models like the 300 series

These different names reflected Chrysler's marketing strategy of giving each division its own identity despite sharing mechanical components. While there were occasionally minor differences in tuning or intake systems, the basic architecture and performance characteristics remained consistent across the divisions.

All versions of the 440 big-block shared:
- Cast iron block and heads
- 10.1:1 compression ratio (until 1971)
- 4.32-inch bore x 3.75-inch stroke
- Hydraulic lifter camshaft
- Single Carter four-barrel carburetor
- Dual exhaust system

The 440's consistent 375 horsepower and 480 lb-ft of torque made it one of the most potent production engines of the era, regardless of which name it carried or which vehicle it powered.

This naming strategy—along with division-specific styling and features—helped maintain distinct brand identities while allowing Chrysler to amortize development costs across multiple models. For today's collectors, it means that the same legendary powertrain can be enjoyed across a diverse array of vehicles at widely varying price points.
