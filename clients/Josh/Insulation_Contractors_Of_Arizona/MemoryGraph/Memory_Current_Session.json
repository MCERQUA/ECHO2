        "Quote: 'Summer is coming and we all know it's going to get really hot! Insulation in my attic has been on my mind and I reached out to Insulation Contractors of Arizona to see how it will work for pricing and timeline. They were extremely responsive on Yelp, got an estimate quickly and was able to be booked the same week. Got to love that quick service! When they showed up the day of, they explained to me on to let me know what they are going to do, how long it will take and to even answer some of my silly questions on the process. They finished the entire job under two hours and even cleaned up any mess they left. My attic now looks like a winter wonderland and hopefully my house will be extra cooler this summer. Highly recommend them for insulation! Great job guys!'",
