# Rate Limit Analysis Log

## Incident Log

### Incident #2 - December 11, 2024
**Error Message:**
```
RateLimitError
Error code: 429
Retry After: 0:01:31 (HH:MM:SS)
Organization rate limit: 40,000 input tokens per minute
```

**Context of Error:**
- Occurred while analyzing document size
- Converting and checking word count of large document
- File operations with document conversion

**Analysis:**
1. **Token Usage Pattern:**
   - Document conversion operation
   - Word count analysis
   - Multiple command executions

2. **Contributing Factors:**
   - Large file processing
   - Multiple sequential operations
   - Format conversion overhead

3. **Optimization Opportunities:**
   - Break document analysis into smaller chunks
   - Add delays between operations
   - Implement staged processing

### Incident #1 - December 11, 2024
**Error Message:**
```
RateLimitError
Error code: 429
Retry After: 0:01:28 (HH:MM:SS)
Organization rate limit: 40,000 input tokens per minute
```

**Context of Error:**
- Occurred while reviewing Safety Manual Project files
- Multiple large file views in quick succession:
  1. Project README.md
  2. section_map.md
  Both files contained substantial content including code blocks and markdown formatting

**Analysis:**
1. **Token Usage Pattern:**
   - Multiple large files viewed consecutively
   - Markdown formatting adds to token count
   - Code blocks and structured data increase token usage

2. **Contributing Factors:**
   - Rapid sequential file reads
   - Large documentation files
   - Complex formatting

3. **Optimization Opportunities:**
   - Space out large file reads
   - Break down large file reviews
   - Implement viewing delays between files
   - Consider chunked file reading

## Suggested Improvements

### Immediate Actions
1. Add delays between large file operations
2. Break down large file reviews into chunks
3. Implement token usage estimation
4. Add cooling periods between heavy operations

### Long-term Strategies
1. Develop token counting system
2. Create file size categories
3. Implement automatic pacing
4. Design operation queuing system

## Token Usage Guidelines

### Estimated Token Costs
- Markdown files: ~1.3x raw text
- Code blocks: ~1.5x content size
- Complex formatting: Additional 10-20%
- File operations: Base cost + content

### Operation Timing
```yaml
file_operations:
  small_files: < 1000 tokens
    delay: none
  medium_files: 1000-5000 tokens
    delay: 2s
  large_files: > 5000 tokens
    delay: 5s
  sequential_reads:
    cooling_period: 3s
```

## Monitoring Strategy

### Metrics to Track
1. Operation types leading to limits
2. Token usage patterns
3. Time between rate limits
4. Success/failure ratios

### Data Collection
```yaml
rate_limit_event:
  timestamp: datetime
  operation_type: string
  content_size: number
  retry_after: duration
  context: string
  optimization_applied: boolean
```
