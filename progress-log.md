### Next Steps Priority
1. Implement rate limiting controls in processing workflow
2. Process Program Overview section
3. Create template automation scripts
4. Establish content review process
5. Set up cross-reference system

### Technical Debt
- Need to establish consistent pause between operations
- Consider batch processing for larger sections
- Implement progress tracking within files

### Questions to Address
1. How to handle very large appendices efficiently?
2. Best approach for managing cross-references?
3. How to maintain consistency across all sections?

## Next Session Goals
1. Implement systematic pauses between operations
2. Process next core section (Program Overview)
3. Refine navigation structure based on initial experience
