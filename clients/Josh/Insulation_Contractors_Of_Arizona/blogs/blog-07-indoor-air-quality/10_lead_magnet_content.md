**"Is Your Arizona Home Making Your Family Sick?"**

Living in Arizona means dealing with extreme heat, dust storms, and challenging air quality conditions year-round. But what many homeowners don't realize is that poor insulation can make indoor air quality problems significantly worse.

**According to the EPA**, Americans spend 90% of their time indoors, where air pollutants can be 2-5 times higher than outdoor levels. In Arizona's extreme climate, inadequate insulation creates the perfect conditions for:

‚úó Dust and allergen infiltration
‚úó Moisture problems leading to mold growth  
‚úó Unfiltered air circulation
‚úó Temperature fluctuations causing air quality issues

**This checklist helps you identify the warning signs** that your home's insulation may be compromising your family's health and comfort.
