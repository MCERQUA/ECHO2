# Doughlirium Website Improvement Project Plan

## Current Website Review

### Website Overview
The current Doughlirium website (https://doughlirium.com/) appears to be a Divi-generated site with basic information about the homebakery business. The site has a standard structure with Home, Menu, About, and Contact pages, but lacks depth, functionality, and a cohesive professional design.

### Strengths
- Domain name is established and branded (doughlirium.com)
- Basic pages are in place (Home, Menu, About, Contact)
- Some product photos are available and properly named for SEO
- Clear business focus: custom cookies, cake pops, and baked treats
- Clean, minimal aesthetic that could be built upon

### Areas for Improvement
- **Content Issues:**
  - Generic stock photos mixed with actual product photos
  - Inconsistent pricing between pages
  - Likely AI-generated content that feels impersonal
  - No clear ordering process or business policies
  
- **Design Issues:**
  - Template-driven appearance lacking brand personality
  - Inconsistent visual style between pages
  - Poor mobile responsiveness in some sections
  - Suboptimal use of actual product imagery
  
- **Functionality Issues:**

  - Contact form likely doesn't submit to anywhere
  - No product catalog or ordering system
  - Missing critical business information (delivery areas, ordering timelines)

- **Technical Issues:**
  - No apparent SEO implementation
